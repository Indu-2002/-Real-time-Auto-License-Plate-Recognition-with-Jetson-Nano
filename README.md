# -Real-time-Auto-License-Plate-Recognition-with-Jetson-Nano
The Real-Time Auto License Plate Recognition (ALPR) System aims to utilize computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms to detect and recognize license plates from live video feeds.By employing the Jetson Nano, a powerful embedded system, the project will enable real-time processing of video streams, making it suitable for applications such as smart parking systems, traffic monitoring, and security surveillance.

"Real-time Auto License Plate Recognition with Jetson Nano" is a Python-based project focused on developing a system capable of automatically recognizing license plates in real-time using a Jetson Nano. Leveraging Python libraries and frameworks, such as OpenCV for computer vision and TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning, this project integrates advanced image processing techniques with embedded system development.

Key components and functionalities of the project include:

Live Video Feed Capture: Python scripts capture live video feeds from a camera connected to the Jetson Nano. OpenCV is utilized to access the camera and retrieve video frames in real-time.

License Plate Detection: Using pre-trained deep learning models or computer vision algorithms, the system detects license plates within the video frames. This involves analyzing the frames to identify regions of interest containing license plates.

License Plate Recognition (OCR): Optical character recognition (OCR) techniques are applied to extract alphanumeric characters from the detected license plate regions. Python libraries like Tesseract OCR or custom-trained deep learning models can be employed for accurate character recognition.

Real-time Processing: The entire process of capturing video frames, detecting license plates, and performing OCR is optimized for real-time performance on the Jetson Nano. Multithreading or asynchronous processing may be utilized to enhance efficiency.

Data Display or Storage: Recognized license plate information, including the extracted alphanumeric characters, may be displayed in real-time on a user interface or stored in a database for further analysis and logging.

Graphical User Interface (Optional): An optional graphical user interface (GUI) may be implemented using Python GUI libraries like Tkinter or PyQt to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system and viewing the live video feed and recognized license plate data.

Overall, this project showcases the capabilities of the Jetson Nano for performing complex image processing tasks in real-time using Python, making it suitable for applications such as traffic monitoring, parking management, and security surveillance.
